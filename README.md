## About this project:

This is the first project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.ccom). The assignment was to create a recipe site using all of the HTML covered in the lesson.

## What I learned:

Going through the lessons on The Odin Project, I acquired the following HTML skills:

- HTML Boilerplate
- How to add links to external sites
- How to link to other HTML files locally on my machine
- How to create ordered and unordered lists
- How to write better commit messages

## Problems Encountered & My Solutions:

Over the course of doing this project, there were a few issues I ran into. Here is how I solved those issues.

**Fractions in the ingredients:** Since this project was supposed to be a recipe website, I needed to list ingredients. For example 1 1/2. I wasn't happy with the way HTML output this if I just entered it. So I went to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7525977/how-to-write-fraction-value-using-html) post and read through the comments and was able to get the fractions formatted in a more traditional way.

## Tools Used:

Throughout this project, I used the following tools:

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
- VS Code
- Linux Terminal & Git
- Xubuntu Linux and VMWare Workstation 17
- Photoshop
